## Summary - Morning

✅ ANN is artificial neural network. Our mind take the data through our senses into neurones which analyze the data and try to mimic. This creates a artificial neural network.

✅ Supervised learning is simply learning in guidence and having someone to measure our learning.

✅ Keras library mainly use to train model using neurones and deep learning.

✅ tensorflow is necessary module in training the neural network which is used by Keras module. That's why it's important.

✅ Dense() takes the argument like unit for number of neurones, the activation function used by neuron, the shape of dataset.

✅ optimizer are used because they help to find the way to train the model with short or effective method.

✅ For keras saving model is simply give save cmd to save like :
Model.save('name')
