## Summary - Morning

✅ The default initializer provided by keras is glorot_uniform. When we use this some random values are given initially to the weights and the bias.

✅ Hyper parameters are the values which we can give by ourselves and can be fine tuned to increase the accuracy of the model.

✅ To create a custom image in docker first we need to sort out our requirements and then we need to proceed to create our own custom image. There are 2 methods of doing so - docker commit method and Dockerfile.

✅ Sometimes requirements come where we need to use a certain docker image with specific files and softwares. Such docker images are not found in any public repo, then we need to create our own custom container image.

✅ After we have created the container image, we can push that image to the docker public repository by using the docker push command. But before that we need to make an account in docker hub and also login into that account from the console using docker login command.

✅ The image name should be of the format -
docker.io/<username>/image_name:versionTag

✅ If we want to share the image locally we need to create a tar file of that image using the docker save command and then copy that tar file to the other users system. In the other system in order to load the image to the local repository we use the docker load command.
