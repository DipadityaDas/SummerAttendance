Session 5: 26th May 2021
Summary:

ðŸ”°1. The predictor line or regression line is the best fit line, with which the line is plotted with the featured variable and the target variable.

ðŸ”°2. Exceptions in the dataset are known as Outliers. Outliers are the data that is too different as compared to the rest of the data.

ðŸ”°3.cost/error is the diff between the actual value(y) and the predicted value(y'), the lesser the cost more accurate is model.

ðŸ”°4. Bias is the constant value that is given in case we want to initialize some value for a feature even if the value of the predictor feature is 0 or something which our model cannot understand.
ðŸ”°5. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a way to predict or understand data with the help of visuals representation such as graphs

ðŸ”°6. Containerization is an amazing and useful technology. An OS can be launched in a second with the help of containers. In this, we launch an OS of any image we have and it consumes less than a second to launch. E.g: Docker 

ðŸ”°7. docker pull image_name is the command to pull the image through docker

ðŸ”°8. "docker run -i -t name:version images_name"
-t this option helps to provide us terminal,
-i this option gives us interactive mode 
   

ðŸ”°9. docker attach <container_name> is used to open the container that is running and to access its terminal.
