# SummerTraining2021
## Session 9: 2 June  2021
## Summary - Morning

✅ We take the help of some Error/cost function like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared error, etc. Basically, Mean absolute error is the sum of all predicted value - actual value. To magnify/zoom we can take the help of the mean square error function.

✅ In the graph, every data point gets plotted, and then ML initializes the value of w and b. So it draws a straight line that goes through data points. So this straight line is known as the prediction line. So ML finds a line that goes through maximum data points and this line is known as the best fit line.

✅ The difference between the predicted value and the actual value is also known as residual.

✅ The sigmoid function is a function that gives a value between 0 and 1. i.e. in this function minimum value is zero and the maximum value is one.

✅ Confusion metrics give details about whether the prediction is accurate or not. There is truly positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative in confusion metrics.

✅ False Positive(FP) error is most dangerous because our predict the result is false but the model predicts positive like if we assume everything is good feeling relax but actually not. 

✅ X11 is a server that provides graphics to the os, we can share this server directory to the docker container in order to support GUI in the docker container also.

✅ The following command is snippet to mount folder between main host to docker Container on launch time.
```shell
$ dockee run -it -v <source main host folder>:<destination folder of container> <image name> 
```

## Summary - Evening

✅ To draw a rectangle use cv2.rectangle() function in the cv2 module.
2. It is a model which has different faces and face detection code which helps in finding the face in an image or video.
3. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.
4. cap.release() is function used to release our camera
5. CascadeClassifier() is a function which is already trained by a different datasets.
6. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.
7. It supports name of the photo, coordinates of point1 & point2, color and thickness.
8. To detect multiple faces, model.detectMultiScale(photo_name) is used.
