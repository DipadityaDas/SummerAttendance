## Summary - Morning

✅ We take the help of some Error/cost function like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared error, etc. Basically, Mean absolute error is the sum of all predicted value - actual value. To magnify/zoom we can take the help of the mean square error function.

✅ In the graph, every data point gets plotted, and then ML initializes the value of w and b. So it draws a straight line that goes through data points. So this straight line is known as the prediction line. So ML finds a line that goes through maximum data points and this line is known as the best fit line.

✅ The difference between the predicted value and the actual value is also known as residual.

✅ The sigmoid function is a function that gives a value between 0 and 1. i.e. in this function minimum value is zero and the maximum value is one.

✅ Confusion metrics give details about whether the prediction is accurate or not. There is truly positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative in confusion metrics.

✅ False Positive(FP) error is most dangerous because our predict the result is false but the model predicts positive like if we assume everything is good feeling relax but actually not. 

✅ X11 is a server that provides graphics to the os, we can share this server directory to the docker container in order to support GUI in the docker container also.

✅ The following command is snippet to mount folder between main host to docker Container on launch time.
```shell
$ dockee run -it -v <source main host folder>:<destination folder of container> <image name> 
```
