## Summary - Morning

✅ CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) is the entire structure network consist of convolution and use of neural network , It includes various layers like Convolution, Pooling, Flatten for feature learning, and dimensionality reduction, along with the neural network for model training. 

✅ CNN is used for Object detection, Face recognition, Image and Video processing.

✅ Conv2D is a function of keras library used to create a convolution layer.

✅ Pooling layer is used to reduce the dimensions of the feature maps to make an simpler, smaller and average, max or global pixel of that dimensions is used to filter the images.

✅ There are two types of pooling layers:-
- Max Pooling
- Average Pooling 

✅ flatten layer converts 2D and 3D array into 1D so that we can use it in neural network for prediction.

✅ Kernel_size is the size of the filter that is used for edge detection so that we can detect the image.

✅ Stride refers to the box that keep on moving step by step, By default it takes 3×3 matrix.

✅ Yes, we can able to make multiple convolutional layers.

✅ Examples of CNN are
- Face Recognition
- Object detection
- Image classification
- Video processing

✅ Fully connected layer is used to connecting all input layers to the activation units of NN layers.
