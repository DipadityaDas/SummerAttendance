🤖 Dataset contains the data to be analyzed in the form of rows and columns. The column names are known as fields/features. Data of 1 row are known as observation/record.
🤖 Confidence score tells us how accurate the model is.
🤖 In simple words Machine learning (ML) means the ability of a machine to learn something new and to learn, as the human brain needs a specific pattern or model of a particular thing to recognize that thing.., in the same way for the machine we have to create that pattern or model in the brain of the machine i.e. we have to give the power of intelligence to the machine & it is known as Artificial Intelligence (AI). This term is called as Artificial Intelligence because it is given by human to the machine & anything which is man-made is called as artificial & the power of intelligence is given by human to the machine hence it is called Artificial Intelligence.
🤖 When the human brain saw a particular thing for the first time, it creates a pattern or model of that thing in it. After creating that pattern inside the brain, humans are able to recognize that particular thing at any time, in this way the human brain learns. And this power of creating a pattern of a particular thing or data is given to the machine by using languages that are understandable by the machine.
