Summary:
✅ There are 2 types of Classification can be seen in deep learning,They are
1. Binary Classification
2. multi-class Classification.

✅ With the help of softmax ( ) function we can able to predict image type data.

✅ Softmax activation function is used in multi classification method.

✅ Softmax function provides a value between 0 to 1 i.e probability value. If we consider if it have 10 classes then it provides the range value of the highest class value which is then used for predict result.

✅ Softmax and sigmoid function is looks similar output only difference is sigmoid is used to give one output and Softmax us used to give multiple outputs based on no of classes.

✅ In Softmax activation function output factor depends on the no of neurons it has in the last layer of Neural Networks.

✅ The best open source data set for ML is MNIST.

✅ With keras.datasets library we can able to import dataset in pandas module.

✅ To convert the test data from 2D to 1D without flatten layer we use reshape( ) a function available from NumPy library.

✅ It is not necessary to use CNN for image prediction ,if we have a scenario where we have to find the edge,set dimension then we need CNN or else it's not necessary to use CNN .
